0x03-debugging -  we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

2-largest_number.c -  correctly prints out the largest of three numbers

3-print_remaining_days.c -  converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
